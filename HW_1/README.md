In the code if the user wants to create new random uniform distribution data, they can change the csv folder path to distribution_path_random. This overwrites the distribution.csv file each time the code executes. If the user wants to observe an example distribution without overwriting it they can change the file path to distribution_path_fixed.

the csv write lines are comment lines in the current code to prevent errors for non-admin users. To try the code fully user can transfer the colab notebook to their google drive folder with their own csv files. Otherwise the code with it's output is visible in the myz_hw1_py.ipynb file.
